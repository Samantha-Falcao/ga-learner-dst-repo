# Project Overview

 The aim of this project is to explore the census data of a country and derive insights from analysis using NumPy. This project involves census record management and data analysis as a part of CACT (Census Analysis and Collection Team). <br/>
**About the Dataset:** <br/>
The dataset has details of 100 people with the following 8 features
| Features | Description |
| -------------- | ------------------- |

## Learnings from the project

 This project helped me to extensively revise and work with fundamental concepts in NumPy module of Python. After completing this project, I got a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, I applied apply the following concepts:
- Array Appending
- Array Slicing
- Array Filtering
- Array Aggregation
