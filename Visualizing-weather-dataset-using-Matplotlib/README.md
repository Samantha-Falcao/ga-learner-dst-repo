### Project Overview

 This project called 'Spy Games' was deigned to decipher secret messages that an agency has received from their intel. They have multiple text files that need to be read and certain operations are required to be performed on these messages to get the final message. This task is to be carried out using fundamentals of python programming.


### Learnings from the project

 The project 'Spy Games' helped me in better understanding of solving logical problems and applying python concepts such as:

- String Operations

- Conditional staements and loops

- File Handling and I/O

- User-defined functions

This project helped me sharpen some fundamental topics in Python.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 I tried breaking down the problem into smaller problems and used multiple user-defined functions to make the code more readable and reusable.
